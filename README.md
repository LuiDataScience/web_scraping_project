# Titanic Project

### Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict survival rates based on various passenger attributes.

### Analysis
We performed various data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, and built machine learning models to predict survival rates.

### Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 80% on the test set.

## Additional Project: Statistical Modeling Project

### Overview
In this project, we conducted statistical hypothesis testing and modeling to explore correlations and trends in the gold stock dataset. Using Python and libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, we performed t-tests, regression analysis, and visualized data to derive insights.

### Results
- Conducted a t-test to compare the means of two columns.
- Identified significant differences between groups.
- Visualized trends over time using line charts and histograms.
